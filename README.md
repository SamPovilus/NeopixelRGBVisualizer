# NeopixelRGBVisualizer
A Neopixel strand visualizer for an audio input that maps frequency distribution to color.  

# Modes
The device has multiple display modes.  To change modes, press the "M" button.

# Settings
To change the settings, press and hold the "M" button for 3 seconds.  The first light in the strand will change color to indicate the setting that will be adjusted.  Press the "M" button again to cycle to the next setting.  After cycling through all the setting modes, the settings will be stored for the next time you plug the device in.  

## Length
When the light is red, press the plus and minus buttons to change the length of the strand.  The strand is made of Neopixels, so it can be cut short (while the power is off) if you need it to be shorter.  To reset to the default 50 lights, press and hold both the plus and minus button at the same time.  

## Gain
When the light is green, press the plus and minus buttons to change the input gain.  Adjusting the gain up is possible but not recommended because the noise will be amplified.  Adjusting the noise down may be necessary.  If the appropriate gain cannot be set, external hardware may be required.  To reset to the default gain, press and hold both the plus and minus button at the same time.
